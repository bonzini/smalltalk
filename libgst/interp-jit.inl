/* This is basically how the interpreter works.

   The interpreter expects to be called in an environment where there
   already exists a well-defined method context.  The instruction
   pointer, stored in the global variable "native_ip", and the stack
   pointer, stored in the global variable "sp", should be set up to
   point into the current method and gst_method_context.  Other global
   variables, such as "_gst_this_method", _gst_self",
   "_gst_temporaries", etc. should also be setup; see the routine
   _gst_prepare_execution_environment for details.  `_gst_interpret'
   immediately calls `_gst_run_native_code' (coded with GNU lightning in
   xlat.c) and starts executing compiled code.
   
   Every now and then, the compiled code checks to see if any change
   in its state is required, such as switching to a new process,
   dealing with an asynchronous signal and printing out the byte codes
   that are being executed, if that was requested by the user.  If so,
   it returns to `_gst_interpret', telling where to restart execution.
   `_gst_interpret' handles the event and passes control back to the
   compiled code.  Control is returned to `_gst_interpret' also when
   the private #__terminate method is executed.

   When a message send occurs for the first time, an internal routine
   (either doSend or doSuper) is invoked (these routines are coded
   with GNU lightning in xlat.c); this routine calls lookup_native_ip,
   which looks for the method in a cache like the one used by the
   standard interpreter, and if it is not found, asks xlat.c to return
   the address; in turn, xlat.c looks for the code into an hash table
   (which handles collisions unlike lookup_native_ip's cache) before
   compiling it.  doSend then saves the returned address so that it
   will be used the next time the message is sent, then it jumps to
   the address.

   If no selector is found, doSend calls lookup_native_ip again,
   asking for the address of the #doesNotUnderstand: method.  Note
   that lookup_native_ip had modified the stack, pushing a gst_message
   object that embeds information about the original selector and
   arguments.  If #doesNotUnderstand: is not understood, a crash is
   extremely likely; things like this are however to be expected,
   since you're really playing a bad game and going against some
   logical things that the VM assumes for speed.

   After the first time, doSend is not called: instead, the previous
   address is used to guess the likely address where the code to be
   called lies.  Of course, the `guessed' address might be wrong,
   because the receiver's class might have changed.  So the prolog of
   every compiled method checks for this eventuality and, if so,
   performs a standard lookup by jumping back to doSend.  Note that
   this cannot happen with doSuper, because super sends always go to
   the same receiver (which is the `_gst_self' object).

   Methods can be marked as doing special things.  These are returning
   self, returning an instance variable, return a literal object,
   or executing a primitive method definition.  In the first three
   cases, the method does not create a context, and immediately jumps
   back to the caller.  In the latter case, the method calls
   execute_primitive_operation, examines its return value, and
   does one of three things: 
   - jumping back to the caller
   - creating a context and executing the Smalltalk code (failure)
   - load a new native_ip and jump there
 
   BlockClosure>>#value is special-cased in that the new native_ip is
   cached in the same way that doSend caches the address of a method.

   When a method returns, the context that called it is examined to
   restore the interpreter's global variables to the state that they
   were in before the callee was invoked.  After the state has been
   restored, the callee jumps back to the caller, almost oblivious to
   the fact that millions of instructions could have been executed
   since control was left.

   Note that the microprocessor's CALL and RETURN instructions are not
   used.  Instead, once the _gst_run_native_code function is called, control
   threads from one method to another, without creating any stack
   frames, mantaining all the information partly inside ContextPart
   objects and partly inside inline_cache structures (see xlat.c): the
   latter also act as continuations that are passed to the callee, which
   stores the continuation info in the ContextPart.  This allows an
   extremely easy implementation of non-local returns.  */


/* This is the bridge between the interpreter and Just-In-Time code
   generation.  It works the same as _gst_send_message_internal, but
   it only looks up the IP for the native code (compiling the bytecode
   on demand if it is not available yet) and returns it to the caller.
   This is because the caller will often be JIT-compiled code which
   likes to set up the execution contexts and to execute primitives on
   its own.  */
